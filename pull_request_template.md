This Pull Request will start automatic compilation, then making + testing of ntuples:

- Don't want to run any of this? (e.g. only XML files) Remove the @: [ci @ skip]

- Only want to compile, but don't make + test ntuples? (e.g. change `CommonModules.cxx`) Remove the @: [only @ compile]

Please include destination branch in title, e.g. `[102X]`, + short meaningful title

Please include an explanation message if it's something more complex than just XML dataset files:
